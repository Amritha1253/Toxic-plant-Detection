# Toxic Plant Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based system to detect **toxic plants** using image classification and botanical features. This project aims to prevent accidental exposure of **humans, pets, and wildlife** to harmful plant species by providing an automated detection and alert mechanism.

##  Project Overview

-  Identifies toxic vs non-toxic plants
-  Uses image-based and feature-based models
-  Accepts input from plant photos or datasets
-  Alerts about potential harmful effects on living organisms
-  Deployable as a web app or mobile scanner

##  Machine Learning Techniques

- **Image Classification** with CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- **Structured Data Classification** with Random Forest / SVM
- **Data Augmentation** to improve model robustness
- Trained on custom + public datasets of toxic and non-toxic plants
